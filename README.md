### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [webhookrelay](https://webhookrelay.com), [keel](https://keel.sh), [sunstone](https://about.sunstone.dev/) and [Apollo](https://apollo-technologies.com). I am also available for a mid to long-term contracts. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Kubernetes, Golang, ML/Data science.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: karolis@webhookrelay.com

Previously I have worked on https://dotscience.com, however it got defunded :S Built lots of interesting things around automating data science pipelines and model deployment to Kubernetes.
